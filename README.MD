This was my first attempt at making a cheap squeeze client for multi room audio. 
I used the ESP32-A1S to avoid having to solder too many SMD parts. This was a mistake as the A1S is a massive pain to work with. 
This board also has a fair amount of digital noise and I'm too inexperienced to determine if its the board design or the A1S. 


I suggest you do not use this version and use my next revision.
